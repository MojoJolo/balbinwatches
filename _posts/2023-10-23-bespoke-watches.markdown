A watch concept: "Through the Windowpane: Horizon"

Capiz shells come from windowpane oysters (hence the name). They are naturally translucent and quite durable. The horizon in the background is hand-painted using acrylic on a 0.05mm stainless steel sheet. The chapter ring is simply a hand-drilled washer.

Most of the components in the dial are handmade, except for the laser-etched and misaligned steel logo.

It's a very rough, quick, but functional concept. I tried it mainly to assess the feasibility, especially the thickness.

I plan to work on this soon and polish it further.
